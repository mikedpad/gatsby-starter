      A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, “to write beside” or “written beside”) is a
      self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A
      paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any
      language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer
      prose.
