# gatsby-v2-starter
Gatsby's default starter with a few changes. Honestly, I'll be truthful... I like to use the semi-colon... There, I've said it! I use `eslint-config-airbnb` on most of my projects as a base guideline and this one is no different. I've also included the `gatsby-plugin-sass` (for now) and will likely customize the webpack config with a alternate set of rules for stylesheets.

And just because I love Microsoft's VSCode, some default ignore settings for the workspace.

### Differences from Gatsby's starter:
- Semicolons! Lots of them!!!
- ESLint for linting and formatting
- Sass + CSS Modules for components
- Manifest generation
- VSCode settings
